- **`mcp_brain-api_get_documentations`**: Access data handling best practices and examples

#### Phase 3: Initial Data Exploration
1. **Statistical Profiling Using BRAIN 6-Tips Methodology**: Run systematic exploratory simulations following the proven BRAIN platform approach. This methodology provides a comprehensive framework for understanding new datafields efficiently. **Critical Settings for All Tests**:
   - **Neutralization**: "None" (to see raw data behavior without masking important patterns)
   - **Decay**: 0 (to preserve actual data values and avoid smoothing out variations)
   - **Test Period**: P0Y0M (for focused analysis)
   - **Focus**: Long Count and Short Count in IS Summary section for insights

   **A. Basic Coverage Analysis**
   - **Expression**: `datafield` (for matrix data type) or `vector_operator(datafield)` (for vector data type)
   - **Purpose**: Determine % coverage = (Long Count + Short Count) / Universe Size
   - **Insight**: Understand basic data availability across instruments
   - **What it tells you**: How many instruments have data for this field on average
   - **Implementation**: Start with this test to establish baseline coverage understanding

   **B. Non-Zero Value Coverage**
   - **Expression**: `datafield != 0 ? 1 : 0` (for matrix) or `vector_operator(datafield) != 0 ? 1 : 0` (for vector)
   - **Purpose**: Distinguish between missing data and actual zero values
   - **Insight**: Long Count indicates average non-zero values on a daily basis
   - **What it tells you**: Whether the field has meaningful data vs. just coverage gaps
   - **Implementation**: Run after basic coverage to understand data quality vs. availability

   **C. Data Update Frequency Analysis**
   - **Expression**: `ts_std_dev(datafield,N) != 0 ? 1 : 0` (for matrix) or `ts_std_dev(vector_operator(datafield),N) != 0 ? 1 : 0` (for vector)
   - **Purpose**: Understand how often data actually changes vs. being backfilled
   - **Insight**: Frequency of unique data updates (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
   - **Key Testing Strategy**:
     - **N = 5 (weekly)**: Long Count + Short Count will be lowest (approx. 1/5th of coverage)
     - **N = 22 (monthly)**: Long Count + Short Count will be lower (approx. 1/3rd of coverage)
     - **N = 66 (quarterly)**: Long Count + Short Count will be closest to actual coverage
   - **What it tells you**: Data freshness patterns and whether data is actively updated or backfilled
   - **Implementation**: Test with various N values to identify the actual update frequency

   **D. Data Bounds Analysis**
   - **Expression**: `abs(datafield) > X` (for matrix) or `abs(vector_operator(datafield)) > X` (for vector)
   - **Purpose**: Understand data range, scale, and normalization
   - **Insight**: Bounds of the datafield values
   - **Testing Strategy**: Vary X values systematically:
     - **X = 1**: Test if data is normalized to values between -1 and +1
     - **X = 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10**: Test various thresholds to understand value distribution
   - **What it tells you**: Whether data is normalized, typical value ranges, and data scale
   - **Implementation**: Start with X = 1, then adjust based on results to map the full value range

   **E. Central Tendency Analysis**
   - **Expression**: `ts_median(datafield, 1000) > X` (for matrix) or `ts_median(vector_operator(datafield), 1000) > X` (for vector)
   - **Purpose**: Understand typical values and central tendency over 5 years
   - **Insight**: Median of the datafield over extended period
   - **Testing Strategy**: Vary X values to understand value distribution:
     - **X = 0**: Test if median is positive
     - **X = 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10**: Test various thresholds to map central tendency
   - **What it tells you**: Whether data is skewed, what typical values look like, and data characteristics
   - **Alternative**: Can also use `ts_mean(datafield, 1000) > X` for mean-based analysis
   - **Implementation**: Test with increasing X values until Long Count approaches zero

   **F. Data Distribution Analysis**
   - **Expression**: `X < scale_down(datafield) && scale_down(datafield) < Y` (for matrix) or `X < scale_down(vector_operator(datafield)) && scale_down(vector_operator(datafield)) < Y` (for vector)
   - **Purpose**: Understand how data distributes across its range
   - **Insight**: Distribution characteristics and patterns
   - **Key Understanding**: `scale_down` acts as a MinMaxScaler that preserves original distribution
   - **Testing Strategy**: Vary X and Y between 0 and 1 to test different distribution segments:
     - **X = 0, Y = 0.25**: Test bottom quartile distribution
     - **X = 0.25, Y = 0.5**: Test second quartile distribution
     - **X = 0.5, Y = 0.75**: Test third quartile distribution
     - **X = 0.75, Y = 1**: Test top quartile distribution
   - **What it tells you**: Whether data is evenly distributed, clustered, or has specific patterns
   - **Implementation**: Test quartile ranges first, then adjust for finer granularity

   **Data Type Considerations**:
   - **Matrix Data Type**: Use expressions directly as shown above
   - **Vector Data Type**: Must use appropriate vector operators (found via MCP) to convert to matrix format
   - **Group Data Type**: Requires special handling - consult MCP documentation for group field operators
   - **Critical**: Always verify data type before testing and use appropriate operators accordingly

   **Implementation Workflow for BRAIN 6-Tips**:
   1. **Setup Phase**: Configure simulation with "None" neutralization, decay 0, and P0Y0M test period
   2. **Sequential Testing**: Run tests A through F in order for systematic understanding
   3. **Iterative Refinement**: Adjust thresholds based on initial results for deeper insights
   4. **Documentation**: Record Long Count and Short Count for each test to build comprehensive profile
   5. **Validation**: Cross-reference results across different N values and thresholds for consistency

   **Expected Results Interpretation**:
   - **Coverage Tests (A & B)**: Should show Long Count + Short Count ≤ Universe Size
   - **Frequency Tests (C)**: Lower N values should show proportionally lower counts
   - **Bounds Tests (D)**: Should reveal data normalization and typical ranges
   - **Tendency Tests (E)**: Should show data skewness and central value characteristics
   - **Distribution Tests (F)**: Should reveal clustering, patterns, and data spread

   **Common Patterns to Watch For**:
   - **Normalized Data**: Values consistently between -1 and +1
   - **Quarterly Updates**: Significant count differences between N=22 and N=66
   - **Sparse Data**: High coverage but low non-zero counts
   - **Skewed Distributions**: Uneven quartile distributions in scale_down tests
   - **Data Quality Issues**: Inconsistent results across different test parameters

   **Practical Example - Closing Price Analysis**:
   **Test A (Basic Coverage)**: `close` → High Long Count + Short Count indicates universal coverage
   **Test B (Non-Zero)**: `close != 0 ? 1 : 0` → Should show same high counts (prices are never zero)
   **Test C (Frequency)**: `ts_std_dev(close,5) != 0 ? 1 : 0` → High counts indicate daily price changes
   **Test D (Bounds)**: `abs(close) > 1` → Should show high counts (prices typically > $1)
   **Test E (Tendency)**: `ts_median(close,1000) > 0` → Should show high counts (median prices are positive)
   **Test F (Distribution)**: `0 < scale_down(close) && scale_down(close) < 0.25` → Tests bottom quartile distribution

   **What This Example Demonstrates**:
   - **Validation**: Confirms expected behavior (prices are positive, change daily, have good coverage)
   - **Pattern Recognition**: Shows how to identify normal vs. abnormal data characteristics
   - **Quality Assessment**: Reveals data consistency and reliability
   - **Alpha Creation Insights**: Understanding price behavior helps in strategy development

   **Troubleshooting Common Issues**:
   - **Zero Counts**: Check if datafield name is correct and data type is appropriate
   - **Unexpected Results**: Verify neutralization is "None" and decay is 0
   - **Vector Field Errors**: Ensure proper vector operator is used for vector data types
   - **Inconsistent Patterns**: Test with different N values and thresholds for validation
   - **Low Coverage**: Consider universe size and data availability in selected region/timeframe

   **Best Practices for Efficient Exploration**:
   - **Start Simple**: Begin with basic coverage tests before complex analysis
   - **Document Everything**: Record all test parameters and results systematically
   - **Iterate Intelligently**: Use initial results to guide subsequent test parameters
   - **Cross-Validate**: Compare results across different test methods for consistency
   - **Focus on Insights**: Prioritize understanding data behavior over exhaustive testing
